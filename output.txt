Turn out onto a lightly floured board, knead for a minute or two, then let rest for 10 minutes. Resume kneading until smooth​, 8 to 10 minutes​.​ (Alternatively, add the sponge and 3 cups flour to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, and knead on low until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the sides of the bowl, 10 minutes.) Cover the bowl and let rise again until doubled in bulk, 45 to 60 minutes. ​","Using a rolling pin, roll out dough until it is 1/3 inch thick. Cut with a round biscuit cutter or with an oval Parker House roll cutter.","Using the dull edge of a knife, make a crease through the center of each piece of dough, brush with melted butter, fold in half along the crease, and press edges lightly together.","Place rolls 1 inch apart on a buttered baking sheet (or use a silicone baking mat). Let rise again until dough has doubled in size, about 45 minutes. (It should feel spongy to the touch, and hold an indentation when pressed with a finger.)","Position a rack in the upper third of the oven and heat to 425 degrees. Bake rolls until golden, about 12 to 18 minutes. Brush again with melted butter. Let cool for a few minutes, then serve warm. The rolls are best when freshly baked but can be reheated in a 350-degree oven for a few minutes prior to serving."],"ingredients":["4 tablespoons butter, at room temperature, plus 4 tablespoons melted butter for brushing dough","2 tablespoons sugar","2 teaspoons salt","2 cups warm milk","1 package dry yeast","6 cups white flour, approximately","Nutritional Information Nutritional analysis per serving (30 servings) 126 calories; 2 grams fat; 1 gram saturated fat; 0 grams trans fat; 0 grams monounsaturated fat; 0 grams polyunsaturated fat; 22 grams carbohydrates; 1 gram dietary fiber; 1 gram sugars; 3 grams protein; 5 milligrams cholesterol; 174 milligrams sodium Note: The information shown is Edamam’s estimate based on available ingredients and preparation.
